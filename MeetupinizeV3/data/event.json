The group is here to provide guidance, help you answer questions (if we can), offer moral support, and keep you focused on your data learning goals.

As a reminder, if you plan to stay for longer than 30 minutes, you need to park in the parking garage (free) around back.</p> <p>Meetup organizers have experience in data analysis, statistics, and data development.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>10:30-11:00 Getting to know each other &amp; networking</p> <p>11:00-12:00 Self-motivated study group. Feel free to use the networking time to gather with folks working on similar projects for the study group portion of the event (i.e., folks working in Python may want to group together while folks working in other programs may want to group together). The idea here is to keep you focused on your data learning and to create an environment where you can learn from other folks within the data industry.</p> <p>Hope to see you all there!</p>",

"description": "<p><b>Description</b></p> <p>Most modern Web APIs use JSON because of its interoperability and widespread use. All modern languages have excellent JSON support, but large, complex data sets often require more functionality than simple serialization/de-serialization.  This presentation shows how to leverage JSON Search and Transform techniques and utilities to simplify working with large JSON data sets returned from Web APIs.</p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Sometimes API Consumers need additional functionality when processing an API’s JSON response:</p> <p>• Access a subset of the data.</p> <p>• Filter results.</p> <p>• Transform the JSON data to another format. </p> <p><br/>Many developers are familiar with serializing/de-serializing JSON data, but end up writing tons of custom code to do more advanced processing. There are excellent JSON Search (e.g., jq) and Transform (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache) utilities that enable Architects and Developers to improve their designs and drastically reduce the amount of effort needed to work with large and/or complex JSON documents.</p> <p>This talk covers JSON Search and Transform:</p> <p>• JSON Search makes your job easier:</p> <p>• How to search JSON documents with jq, including:</p> <p>• Online Testers</p> <p>• Command Line</p> <p>• Application Code</p> <p>• How to write unit tests that search the content of JSON documents returned by a web API.</p> <p>• Use JSON Transform to:</p> <p>• Convert JSON to HTML.</p> <p>• Convert a JSON document to a new (JSON) structure.</p> <p>• Convert JSON with Online Testers and command line tools.</p> <p>• Write unit tests that transform the content of JSON documents returned by a Web API.</p> <p>This session will show practical JSON-based workflows, and provide techniques to search and transform JSON documents.</p> <p>Example code will leverage jq, Handlebars, Mustache, JavaScript, and Node.js.</p> <p><b>Tom Marrs</b> is passionate about demonstrating the business value of technology. As an Enterprise Architect at TEKsystems Global Services, he leverages the enabling architectures and technologies that fuel the growing API Economy – REST, Microservices, and JSON. Tom has led enterprise-class API, Web, Mobile, Cloud, and SOA projects. An avid Agilist, Tom is a Certified Scrum Master and enjoys mentoring and coaching project teams.</p> <p>Tom recently wrote JSON at Work for O’Reilly, and wrote the Core JSON Refcard on DZone (the #1 downloaded Refcard in 2013). In a past life, Tom co-authored JBoss at Work for O’Reilly. Tom has also been a speaker at the OSCON, No Fluff Just Stuff (NFJS) and Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS) conferences. He hopes to speak again at these conferences in the near future.</p>",

"description": "<p>At least two people came to me after our Masterminding session and told me that I <b>MUST HAVE</b> Annie Murlowski (of <a href=\"http://rockymtnbliss.com/\">Rocky Mountain Bliss</a>) speak at a future event. Little did they know that I had already been in talks with the talented Annie about doing just that.</p> <p><br/>Annie is a SEO superstar and promises to share her basic and high-level SEO tips with our group. No matter where you are in your SEO journey, she is going to give you a nugget of information you can take home and implement in your blog. These are going to be real-life, practical, anyone-can-do kinda tips that will set your blog on SEO fire!</p> <p>I personally know that some of the SEO strategies I've learned over the years have changed my blog for the better. I'm benefiting from those strategies today and can't wait to hear more things from an expert such as Annie.</p> <p>And guess what?  We have a freaking amazing venue as our sponsor!!  </p> <p>Yep, we're visiting <a href=\"http://www.opheliasdenver.com/\">Ophelia's</a> - an upscale gastropub with boudoir-style decor and the third concept restaurant from the owner of Linger and Root Down. Ophelia's promises to be an exciting place for us to meetup! </p> <p>A few things about this event:</p> <p>1. Annie is going to speak first at 5:30 pm, so PLEASE don't be late. Leave yourself plenty of time to get there - traffic will be a bear but this will be SOOO worth it! Food and a talk from Ophelia's will follow Annie at around 6:30pm.</p> <p>2. Starting at 8:00 pm (if you want to stay late), it's open mic night at Ophelia's. I plan to stay for a bit to see what it's all about. Here's <a href=\"http://www.opheliasdenver.com/event/1554251-ophelias-open-mic-soul-daddy-denver/\">more info for Oct. 17's open mic night</a>. (It's free to stay, but if you want to drink \"adult\" beverages at any time this night, you need to start your own tab.)</p> <p>3. If anyone wants to ride with me from I-25 and Orchard, let me know!  If you want/need to carpool from your location, please leave a comment here or on our Facebook page.</p> <p>4. Parking is on the street surrounding the venue. There is no valet on Tuesday night.</p> <p>5. Please bring a little something extra to tip our servers.</p> <p>As always, our events are free for bloggers, but I do ask that you give our sponsor lots of social media love - you can start at anytime (even now). The more love you give, the easier it is for me to find awesome sponsors like Ophelia's to partner with.</p> <p>Ophelia's on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/opheliasdenver/\">Facebook</a></p> <p>Ophelia's on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opheliasden\">Twitter</a></p> <p>Ophelia's on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/opheliasden/\">Instagram</a></p> <p>Our event is limited to 30 bloggers. Please RSVP if you have every intention of showing up. I know last minute things happen that might cause you to cancel, but please take your RSVP serious because I do. :-)</p> <p>Also, please please please make sure you're getting notifications from Meetup - this way if you're on the waitlist - you will be notified if your RSVP changes to \"yes\". </p> <p>Thanks all - looking forward to another exciting event with my blogger friends!</p>",

There is a lightrail stop at the corner of where the meetup is.</p> <p>Talks/topics to be covered:</p> <p>How Browsers Get Data <i>by Chandler Prall</i></p> <p><br/>As web developers it is important to understand what our browsers do behind the scenes to communicate with and get data from servers. What does devtools mean by \"DNS lookup\", \"initial connection\", or \"Waiting (TTFB)\", and why is this important to me? This is a deep dive into internet connections and the dangerous journey all data takes as it moves to and from users, from the network layer in your operating system all the way to the browser's enforcement of Cross Origin Resource Security (CORS, aka the devil).</p> <p>\n\n\nAn Offline-Only Website: Lessons Learned <i>by Chris Bolin</i></p> <p>How to (and how to not) make offline React apps, publish an open source library, deal with fleeting viral fame, cope with trolls, translate into multiple languages, and promote your work. We’ll walk through a weird project I made and what it taught me.</p>",

I don't have a particular project idea in my mind at the moment but we will start with any project which is already existing, to help the beginners and those who forgot about the development process. </p> <p>There won't be any presentation which everyone listen and then go home, might return next time. This year, I will be working on a project and anyone can join me at anytime and we can discuss whats going on and can start themselves on the project or you can bring any other (java)project and can work or can get help on your already working project. This would be a <b>discussion-working on projects group</b>. If you are not working on any project or don't have an interest to do a project, Still you are welcome to meet interesting women and spend some time. <b>You might get a spark to do something that you love!</b></p> <p>Beginners who are not familiar with basics of java will be helped to start Java programming. All are welcome!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml\">Helpful link to install Java</a></p> <p><br/>Recommended: Any IDE for coding in Java, like NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Sublime, DrJava etc...</p> <p>Our Format: This is a self-directed session where you can work through your latest project, tutorial, or book. Bring your current project and work on it, collaborate, or get some help! Here and there we will have members do small presentations on Java topics. This will be an inclusive work session where we can spend some time upgrading our own skills and helping each other build theirs.</p> <p>Where: We are hosted at Denver tech-hub Galvanize, located at 1062 Delaware St, Denver CO(11th and Delaware). Signs will be posted at Galvanize!</p>",

And, for each MVP there are two or three alumni who have moved to other seasons in their career. Colorado is teeming with Microsoft MVP awardees. </p> <p><i>Each MVP has a specialty: Client, Tooling, Cloud, and more. Each has a contribution area: SQL, C#, UWP, Azure, and more. And, each has demonstrated a deep passion for their own contributions back into their local, online, and regional developer communities. I would be that if you've ever met an MVP, you've likely met them at an event or heard them speak at meetups. Contributors identified as thought leaders and industry experts are recognized by Microsoft and renewed annual for their hard work, contribution and excellence. </i></p> <p><br/><b>If you are an MVP or an MVP alumni</b>, this event is <i>exclusively </i>for you. A few times a year we get together for a meet-and-greet happy hour. This is your chance to talk shop, compare notes and rub elbows with other contributors like yourself. It's time for our Autumn Happy Hour. The calendar <a href=\"https://doodle.com/poll/79icngdgimerhbe3\">orchestration </a>is over, and we landed on Wednesday, October 18th. </p> <p>I am still working on the location, but I wanted to set this up so you could RSVP today and save the date in your calendar for this fun event.

It is a hybrid approach using the best of 3NF and dimensional modeling. It is not a replacement for star schema data marts (and should not be used as such).

Deep Q Networks (DQN) are an intuitive and easy to implement approach to deep reinforcement learning.  At this meeting, Dana will demonstrate how a DQN agent can learn to play a suite of Atari games, using only raw pixels and the score as input.

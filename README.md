## Synopsis

An app for easily finding meetup events in a 10 mile radius of the user given zipcode.

Meetupinize.com is currently running v2. v3 is in development which is switching the codebase to Angular.

## Motivation

Meetup's search function is not the best. It will not display all the events for a particular event category and in general isn't the easiest experience for quickly finding events in your area. This was built to solve that issue.
